# Python-Modules
My Python Modules
These modules, which I publish here, are based on my own ideas which I have implemented with the help of Chat-GPT.
Since I still don't have enough knowledge about Python myself, I can't claim the correctness of the code.
I would therefore appreciate it if someone who knows more about programming than I do would take a look at this code and put any corrections in a commit.
Any help is always welcome and the code is freely available.
